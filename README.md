### 3. School Size

- Under 150 students is often not worth the effort, unless it is a part of a franchise in which case it is easier to get many of them
- 150-5000 students is a good size
- 5000 - 10,000 students is a good but is likely not an ideal school type (usually public or community college)
- 10,000+ students would be awesome, but is usually not the right school type and we might only be able to get a small portion of the school

### 4. LMS

- Canvas

- Any schools marked with "Not Viable" means they are either not a school or the school has closed. These schools should be filtered out.
